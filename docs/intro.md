# Introduction

The world's first open source blog. (Technically not a blog)

This site is experimental is actively being worked on. It is going to be used to test whether this method of writing articles is viable. See [Road map](#road-map) for how this app will evolve in the future.

I am currently streaming when working on the site so you can tune in on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ridhwanio) or watch the streams back on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjo7yp0_3p4).

#### Update 30/07/2022

The app is still useless for the readers. It's currently at the point where we need to create the resources. I encourage anyone to make suggestions to begin with as the idea of this is that it will grow over time.

## What is it?

On this app you will find resources for all sorts of things, mainly targeting tech industry standards at the moment. However the information on this website is and will be written by the community. This means that we won't have one single person's opinion on each specific topic or multiple different articles on the same topic. Collaboratively we will write the best and most accurate guidelines and information that suits the topic at the given time.

## Why is this a thing?

There are many things that make a successful team and a flourishing company. There are several layers and may different positions at each level. Sometimes it may not always be clear what the responsibilities for each one is.

Swarm will provide the right guidance and outline the key responsibilities for each role so that individuals can maximize their contribution whilst attaining the most benefit from those around them.

## Who is it for?

Currently this is targeted to anyone who works in the tech space. The caveat being that only developers or who don't mind using **git** can contribute new ideas. This means it's an amazing time to make contributions to the articles to express opinions and thoughts that you may have.

Once the resources have matured, this will become a useful tool for any readers in the tech space to come to and learn about things and make reference to solid opinions approved by professionals around the world.

## How to contribute

The method to contribute will improve in the future to a more streamlined approach, but for now:

- Head over to the [Github](https://github.com/RidhwanDev/Swarm/) page.
- Fork the repo
- Make changes to the the `md` files under `/docs`
- Commit your changes to your Fork
- Raise a PR against the master branch on github
- Once the PR is approved and merged the changes will automatically be deployed to the site.

There is more detailed explanation in the Readme file which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/RidhwanDev/Swarm/).

## Road map

This site will be a throwaway site in the future. The current way of contributing is much to long and is only available to those who can use git.

The main reason for using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is to spin something up quickly and easily. This way we can run the experiment on producing the resources to see whether or not this is viable. It can either create extraordinary resources which will provide it's reader with very accurate and high recommended information or the idea many people contributing to the same article will just lead to creating chaos and nothing useful will come out it.

Given the experiment is successful.

The app will be built from the ground up.

- Users will be able to log in using Github
- Users will be able to highlight and select texts the want to change
- Users can make suggestions on the spot in that site and raise that as a new suggestion
- Users will be able to have visual tips showing where suggestions have been made
- Users will be able to view all suggestions
- Users will be able to upvote or downvote suggestions
- When a suggestion reaches a certain amount of upvotes it will be automatically merged into the document
