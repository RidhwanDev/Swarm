# How to empower your team

Sometimes, the best way to help yourself is to help those around you.

Feedback is critical for the people you work with. In a 2018 study, Aptitude Research Partners found that 72% of participants rated "Employee Recognition" as having the greatest impact on employee engagement. Recognition is valued whether it comes from management, fellow team members, or clients, as long as it's authentic and timely. Specific praise that's crafted for an individual and given as soon as possible will outshine a quick "good job" any day of the week, and will definitely prove more beneficial than no recognition at all. Not only will regular recognition improve the overall morale of the team, it's also been proven to increase factors such as productivity and retention. Taking the extra time to write a note or recognize someone in a meeting may seem frivolous on a surface level but the immediate impact on that person and the ripple effects on the overall culture of the team are well worth the investment.
